  File Structure:
    elevator-project contains everything you need to run the actual program
    all the source code is in src\main\java\elevatorstuff
    the filenames in there should be self explanatory (FloorSubSystem contains code for the floor system, Scheduler contains code for the scheduler, etc.)
    you'll want to import the whole of elevator-project into eclipse to get things running
    
   Running:
    after you've imported everything into eclipse, you should be able to run the project as a java application
    
    Testing:
